# Documentation Strategy

This document explains the hybrid documentation approach used in the Lokvani frontend project.

## 🎯 **Hybrid Documentation Approach**

We use a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of both centralized and distributed documentation:

### 📁 **Centralized Documentation (`docs/`)**

**Purpose:** High-level, cross-cutting concerns and developer guides

```
docs/
├── setup/              # Project setup and configuration
├── development/        # Development guidelines and best practices
├── features/           # Cross-cutting features (theming, auth, routing)
├── components/         # Component library overview
└── deployment/         # Production deployment guides
```

**Use for:**

- Project setup and configuration
- Development guidelines and best practices
- Cross-cutting features (theming, authentication, routing)
- Architecture decisions and patterns
- Deployment and operations
- Developer onboarding

### 📁 **Distributed Documentation (`src/`)**

**Purpose:** Code-specific documentation and implementation details

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── README.md       # Component directory overview
│   └── docs/           # Component-specific documentation
├── pages/
│   ├── README.md       # Page directory overview
│   └── docs/           # Page-specific documentation
├── lib/
│   ├── README.md       # Utility functions overview
│   └── docs/           # Library-specific documentation
└── themes/
    └── docs/           # Theme implementation details
```

**Use for:**

- Component usage examples and patterns
- API documentation and code examples
- Implementation details and code-specific guides
- Local development and maintenance
- Code organization and structure

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Approach**

### ✅ **Advantages**

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - High-level docs in `docs/` for architecture and processes
   - Code-specific docs in `src/` for implementation details

2. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Developers can find relevant docs near the code
   - New team members can start with high-level docs in `docs/`
   - Experienced developers can dive into code-specific docs

3. **Maintainability**
   - Code changes can easily update nearby documentation
   - High-level docs remain stable and don't clutter the codebase
   - Clear ownership of different types of documentation

4. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add new documentation categories
   - Can grow with the project without cluttering
   - Supports both technical and non-technical documentation

5. **Searchability**
   - Clear folder structure makes finding docs easier
   - Related documentation is grouped together
   - Can use tools to search across all documentation

### ⚠️ **Considerations**

1. **Documentation Duplication**
   - Some information might exist in both places
   - Need to maintain consistency between docs

2. **Navigation Complexity**
   - Developers need to know where to look for different types of docs
   - Cross-references between docs and code docs

3. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - More places to update when things change
   - Need clear guidelines on what goes where

## 📋 **Documentation Guidelines**

### **What Goes in `docs/`**

- Project setup and installation
- Development environment setup
- Architecture decisions and patterns
- Cross-cutting features (theming, authentication, routing)
- Deployment and operations
- Developer onboarding and best practices
- High-level component library documentation

### **What Goes in `src/`**

- Component usage examples and patterns
- API documentation and code examples
- Implementation details and code-specific guides
- Local development and maintenance
- Code organization and structure
- Specific component or page documentation

### **Cross-References**

- Link between `docs/` and `src/` documentation
- Use relative paths for internal links
- Maintain consistent naming and structure
- Update both when making changes

## 🔄 **Maintenance Strategy**

### **When to Update Documentation**

1. **Code Changes**
   - Update `src/` docs when changing implementation
   - Update `docs/` when changing architecture or patterns

2. **New Features**
   - Add to `docs/features/` for cross-cutting features
   - Add to `src/` for specific component or page features

3. **Process Changes**
   - Update `docs/development/` for development process changes
   - Update `docs/deployment/` for deployment process changes

### **Documentation Review Process**

1. **Code Review**
   - Check if documentation needs updates
   - Verify examples still work
   - Ensure consistency between docs and code

2. **Regular Audits**
   - Review documentation quarterly
   - Remove outdated information
   - Update cross-references

3. **User Feedback**
   - Collect feedback from developers
   - Identify missing or unclear documentation
   - Improve based on usage patterns

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **1. Consistency**

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow the same structure across all docs
- Use consistent formatting and style

### **2. Clarity**

- Write clear, concise documentation
- Use code examples where helpful
- Include screenshots or diagrams when needed

### **3. Maintenance**

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code
- Remove outdated information
- Update cross-references when moving content

### **4. Discoverability**

- Use clear folder and file names
- Include README files in each directory
- Create index files for easy navigation

## 📚 **Examples**

### **High-Level Documentation (`docs/`)**

```markdown
# Theming System

This document explains the theming system architecture,
how to use it, and how to extend it.

## Architecture

- CSS variables approach
- Theme provider implementation
- Color token system

## Usage

- Basic theming
- Custom themes
- Theme switching

## Implementation

See [Component Usage Guide](../../src/components/docs/USAGE.md)
for detailed implementation examples.
```

### **Code-Specific Documentation (`src/`)**

````markdown
# Component Usage Guide

Detailed usage examples for all components.

## Button Component

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

<Button variant='outline' size='lg'>
  Click me
</Button>;
```
````

## Theme Integration

All components support the theme system.
See [Theming System](../../../docs/features/THEMING.md) for details.

```

## 🚀 **Future Improvements**

1. **Automated Documentation**
   - Generate API docs from TypeScript interfaces
   - Auto-update component examples
   - Sync documentation with code changes

2. **Interactive Documentation**
   - Live component examples
   - Interactive code playground
   - Search functionality

3. **Documentation Testing**
   - Test code examples in documentation
   - Verify links and cross-references
   - Automated documentation validation

This hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: centralized high-level documentation and distributed code-specific documentation, making it easy for developers to find the information they need when they need it.
