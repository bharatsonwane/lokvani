## 🔄 Recent Updates

### Backend Architecture Improvements (Latest)

The backend has undergone significant improvements in architecture, service patterns, and middleware:

#### Service Layer Refactoring
- **Static Method Migration**: All service methods converted to static pattern for better performance and consistency
- **Object Parameter Pattern**: Service methods now accept structured object parameters for improved maintainability
- **Enhanced User Service**: Added conditional password inclusion and role aggregation in user queries
- **Role Integration**: User queries now return roles as structured arrays with lookup table relationships

#### Middleware and Error Handling
- **Morgan Removal**: Eliminated HTTP request logging middleware for cleaner terminal output
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Migrated from individual controller error responses to global error middleware
- **Enhanced Database Middleware**: Improved connection cleanup with double-release prevention
- **Simplified Response Format**: Streamlined API responses with consistent error handling

#### Database and Schema Updates
- **Updated Database Schema**: Table renamed from `user_profile` to `app_user` with enhanced field structure
- **Role System Integration**: Implemented user-role relationships through junction tables
- **Query Optimization**: Enhanced queries with JSON aggregation for complex data structures

#### Developer Experience
- **Terminal Output Enhancement**: Vite-style colored and clickable API documentation URLs
- **Improved Logging**: Cleaner development experience with focused application logs
- **Better Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript interfaces and type inference throughout

For detailed information, see:
- [Middleware Architecture Updates](./architecture/MIDDLEWARE.md#recent-updates)
- [API Response Format Changes](./api/API.md#response-format)
- [Database Schema Changes](./api/DATABASE.md#app-user-table)
